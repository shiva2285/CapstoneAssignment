London also has largest __financial__ institutions and is also home to __top-ranked__ universities in the world. ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London))\n",

    "London has always been a __dream__ city for me personally to move and live there. To move to such a vibrant city, one of the main concerns is to find good __affordable__ accomodation in a __safe__ neighborhood. Therfore in this project, I intend to explore London neighborhoods and find the best the neighborhood to move in. This project could potentially help other people who have similar interests to move to London and live there.  \n",
