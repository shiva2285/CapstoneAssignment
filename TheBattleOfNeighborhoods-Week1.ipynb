London also has largest financial institutions and is also home to top-ranked universities in the world. \n\nLondon has always been a dream city for me personally to move and live there. To move to such a vibrant city, one of the main concerns is to find good affordable accomodation in a good neighborhood. Therfore in the project, i intend to explore London neighborhoods and find the best the neighborhood to move in. This project could potentially help other people who have similar interests to move to London and live there.
